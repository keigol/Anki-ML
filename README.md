# Anki-ML
CPSC 440 (Advanced Machine Learning) Project by Jack Gao, Jerry Tan and Keigo Lee

## Problem Statement

The focus of this project is to enhance the prediction accuracy of Anki flashcards for determining when users are likely to forget certain concepts or information.

This project aims to come up with a better alternative for the SM-2 algorithm. SM-2 is a dated 1990 era algorithm. Newer machine learning techniques may lead to better scheduling of flashcards, which will improve the learning experience.
